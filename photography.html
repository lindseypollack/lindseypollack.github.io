	<h1>Lindsey's Photographs</h1>
	<p> Here are some of my favorite photographs I've taken. I have always been interested in photography because of my dad and hope to continue this passion and advance my skills through life.<p>
	<p> I usually photograph with my Nikon D3400 camera, but if it's not around, I'll use my iPhone.<p>
	<p> You can find more of my past photography work <a href="https://lindseypollack14.wixsite.com/mysite" target="_blank">here</a><p>
