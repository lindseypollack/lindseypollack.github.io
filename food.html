	<h1>Lindsey's Eats</h1>
	<p> This is my first year living in an apartment and I've finally learned how to cook for myself. It's been super fun to learn new recipes but the following foods weren't all made by me.<p>
	<p> I hope these treats make you drool!<p>

	<h2>The following foods include:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Penne Alla Vodka at a restaurant</li>
			<li>Avocado / Peanut Butter toast that I staged a photoshoot for</li>
			<li>Ice cream sundae waffle that I drew from a photograph</li>
		</ol>
